## Hints for students that feel lost at the beginning

 * **Try to use bash/terminal on daily basis.**
    When doing assignments/projects for other courses, switch from GUI to terminal. 
    Maybe at the begging you will be slower and annoyed. Maybe you will have to look up every single command, 
    but believe me, working from terminal is much more efficient than using GUI in majority of the cases. 
    This is also the best way to learn about bash and GNU utils.
    
 * Take a regex course (e.g. https://regexone.com/)   
   Regular expression are extremely useful tool for everyone who is working with text data 
   (very likely that you get some on the exam).
   
 * Take a look at the exercise sheet before the class (and try to solve it). 
   You have only 1.5h in the tutorial and we have to proceed quite fast with the material.
   If you see the exercises for the first time in the class, it's very hard to follow.
